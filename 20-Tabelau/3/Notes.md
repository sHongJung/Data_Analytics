## 20.3 - Wrap up Tableau

### Goals

* We'll spend most of class having y'all 1.) analyze your own data and 2.) present some of the resulting visualizations to the class!

### Notes

* We'll start machine learning on Wed.

### Exercises

#### Students Do - Healthcare (30 min)

#### Review Healthcare (10 min)

#### Students Do - Airlines (15 min)

#### SKIP Languages Exercise

#### Students Do - Mini Projects (1 hour)

* Pick a _new_ dataset you haven't analyzed before.
* Suggested data sets: [data.sfgov.org](https://datasf.org/opendata/), [data.gov](https://www.data.gov/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [Github repo of public datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets).
* **Try to spend no more than 10 minutes finding a dataset**.
* Spend the rest of the hour developing and quickly testing hypotheses, using all the features of Tableau you've learned to build beautiful visualizations.
* Try to develop just 2 - 3 key visualizations, each with some polish. Quality > Quantity.
* However, note that you may throw away 10 or 20 other visualizations as you search for meaning, but don't find any.
* Try to create a dashboard or a story in Tableau.

#### Students Do - Presentations

* No Powerpoint needed - we want to see your viz!
* 3-4 minutes each. **We want key takeaways. The charts should speak for themselves**.
* I also want y'all to practice your visualization skills by helping identify improvements in your peers' work in a kind and constructive way.
