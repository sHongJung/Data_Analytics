<p>
 I have 3 and half years of experience as a semiconductor process engineer at Samsung Electronics.<br>
I also have experience a back-end software engineer for 2 years and I taught students physics, thermodynamics<br>
and basic Java programming as a lecturer.<br>
 After that, I have built my career as a software engineer. <br>
I worked for a telecommunication company as a software developer using C/Python language on Linux environment.<br>
So, I hope that I get a job to use software skills for analyzing data in manufacturing or financial industry.
