# Embed CARTO

In this activity, we will create a new HTML page using Bootstrap, embed a CARTO map we created earlier, and deploy the page to Github Pages.

## Instructions

* This web page should describe the data being displayed on the map and utilize the Bootstrap grid and components.

* Deploy the web page to Github Pages when complete.

* Below are instructions for publishing a CARTO map:

  1. CARTO maps may be embedded using an iframe element.

  2. To publish your map for embedding, complete the following steps:

     1. Inside the "Layers" view, click the SHARE button at the bottom of the left sidebar.
