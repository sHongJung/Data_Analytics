## Multiple Lines and Axes

* Create a line chart to display the relationship (or lack thereof) between the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the number of Smurf sightings.

### Instructions

* Begin by inspecting the data provided to you in the CSV file.

* Alter the code from the previous activity to plot a multi-line and multi-axes line plot of the data provided (the `app.js` file from the last exercise is provided for you in the `Unsolved` directory).

* Instead of relying on the `attr` method to set colors and styles for our elements, try as much as possible to use the styling provided in the CSS file to make the graph more readable (i.e. set the classes of the elements accordingly).

### Hints

* For reference on creating a date parser, see [D3 Documentation-Time Format](https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format#locale_format).

* For reference on properly placing axis titles, see [MDN - Text Anchor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/text-anchor).
