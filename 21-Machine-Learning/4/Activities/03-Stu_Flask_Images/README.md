# Flask Image Preprocessing

In this activity, you will build a Flask app that allows a user to upload an image, saves the image, and then reloads the image using Keras and pre-processes the images using a given function.

### Instructions

* Take a minute to understand the provided start code.

* Create code that will:

  * Read the file.
  * Save the filename to a variable.
  * Save the uploads folder path to a variable.
  * Save the file to the path.
  * Load the image using Keras and resize it to 28 by 28 pixels.
  * Preprocess the image with the given function, `prepare_image`.

### Hint

* Use the code from previous activities as a guide.

* For more information on uploading files with Flask see [Flask - Uploading Files](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/patterns/fileuploads/).
