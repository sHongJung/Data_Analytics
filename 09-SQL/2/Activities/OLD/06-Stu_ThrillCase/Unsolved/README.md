# The Thrill of the CASE

## Instructions

* In this activity, you will practice using the `CASE` statement in MySQL, which lets you construct conditions for executing MySQL code.

* If you aren't already in `top_songsDB`, switch to it.

* In the `top5000` table, create a `CASE` statement so that in the second row:

  * If the `artist` name is "Bill van Halen," change it to "Bill van Halen and the Licks" 
  * If it's "Bill Haliday," change it to "Bill Haliday and the Jazz"
  * Otherwise, change it to "Bill Haley and the Comets"

## Bonus

* Create a `CASE` statement so that:
  * If the `artist` name is "Bing Crosby," change it to "Bill Throggs Neck" 
  * If it's "Celine Dion," change it to "Sarah Hellion"
  * Otherwise, change it to "Skrillex"
  * But make these modifications **only** in rows 1 through 5!
